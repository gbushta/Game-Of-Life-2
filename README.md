# Game-Of-Life-2
2019 Supercon Badge Game Of Life that stays within the confines of the screen.

After much trouble I finally got the files uploaded to this repo.  I was trying to use the terminal on a Mac.
I would get an error about there is not commit checked out when attempting to git add . .  But I could add files one
at a time, or add them with a wild card.  I think the folder "https:" with the file github.com in side it was the one that was causing the commit not checked out problem.

This version is the first one that I made of Conway's Game of Life for the Supercon Badge.
The living objects do not wrap around to the other side.

You can just copy the .elf file to your badge to be up and running, or you can make it again and then copy the .elf file.
Instructions are on the front screen.  You can change the seed for random so the pattern doesn't always show the same thing
every time.
